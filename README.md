# Introduction

Did you know the air quality indoors matters as much as the quality of air outdoors? Bad indoor air quality has been linked to debilitating effects, most commonly, lung diseases, stroke, heart disease, and even lung cancer. Not only that, but bad indoor air quality may affect your ability to focus and work. The worst part is, most of these bad things floating around in your room are odorless and invisible to the naked eye.

## Introducing aerate

Aerate is a user-friendly cloud-based web application and hardware device that visualizes and informs you of the air quality in your room caused by exposure to dust particles, gasses, chemicals, and more! The application allows monitoring of your room while visualizing it in colorful, user-friendly graphics and even provides tips on increasing air quality! The app also acts as an alarm if a pollutant in your room passes a dangerous threshold.

Working using cloud technology, the app works on all your devices and can be used even when you are not at home, keeping your family safe from dangerous air. Here is the big picture of aerate:

# Getting Started

### User Manual:

- [User Manual](https://github.com/jamesadhitthana/aerate/raw/main/Documentation/User%20Manual.pdf)

### Documentation:

- [API Reference](https://github.com/jamesadhitthana/aerate/raw/main/Documentation/API%20Reference.pdf)

### Notes:

- On esp.ino, define your own FIREBASE_HOST and FIREBASE_AUTH using your own Firebase credentials (if you don't have one, you need to create one first on firebase.google.com).
- On login.html, register.html, unified.js, and index.html, change the Firebase API Keys to your own.
- aerate was built for my university dissertation and therefore we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature.
